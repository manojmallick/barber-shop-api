## Barber Shop
```
He wants you to create a booking system that will allow his customers to book an appointment with a barber of their preference. 
he can't really gather any information on customer's satisfaction, send them reminders or collect any other useful metrics to boost his business...
```
With that said, I guess we should start with helping him! We first begin by splitting the work into smaller chunks, because, you know...agile! We then mix in some priority and call them **phases**. So, let's start!
## Motivation
Helping every barber who want him to have a online presence in this competitive world.

## Features
Helping out all the barbers out there who cannot invest money.(It contains only one part of the full application i.e. API )
#### Phase 1
- In this first phase, the least that we can do is to appoint the customer a barber that is available. Each booking must claim a time slot of 30 minutes.

#### Phase 2
- The customer can either pick a time slot where he will be able to see which barber is available or be able to select a barber and see his schedule. The barbers should be ordered by experience_level. It's up to you what defaults you choose, but hey Edwin does care about the customer journey, or as he likes to call it, "The clever stuff"!

#### Phase 3
- As a shop owner, I want to be able to see metrics about the barbers, clients and appointments.
- As a customer, I want to be able to change, update or delete my appointment
- As a customer, I want to receive a reminder 1 hour before my appointment.
- As a customer, I want to be do recurring bookings. Let's say every 2 weeks or perhaps every Month.
- As a shop owner, I want customers to be able to join a wait list if no bookings are available.
